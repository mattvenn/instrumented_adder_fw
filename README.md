As I don't know how to get the serial out of the ftdi, 
needs serial device connected to 5 and 6
5 is rx
6 is tx

I used arduino nano 3.3v and leonardo
then program a firwmare that just echos forwards and backwards (see in serial test directory)

make monitor to start serial

if it doesn't work then flash the serial test first then this one.
